# Project Visions for Monash Assistive Tech Team (MATT)

## Background
Parinaud Syndrome is a neurological condition that affects eye movement control, often resulting in upward gaze paralysis and convergence difficulties. Individuals with this condition face significant challenges with depth perception, spatial navigation, and visual coordination in their daily activities.
Our team is developing an innovative AR/VR solution using the Apple Vision Pro to create assistive technologies that enhance independence and quality of life for individuals living with Parinaud Syndrome.

## Problem Statement
People with Parinaud Syndrome experience:
 - Limited vertical eye movement (especially upward gaze)
 - Convergence insufficiency affecting near vision tasks
 - Depth perception difficulties due to impaired binocular vision
 - Spatial navigation challenges in complex environments
 - Reduced independence in daily activities requiring precise visual coordination

## What we have so far
Depth Perception Visualizer - A ball cursor tracks depth as user navigates through an open space.

## Goals for this year
2. integrate LLMs to generate useful information of their surroundings for the individual.
3. Object detection for common household items
